We'll start with a quick demonstration of how to read data into R using base R functions. These are functions that are part of R's basic install, which means that you do not have to load up any special packages to use them. We'll just look at a few of the most common functions. In the next sections we'll look at Tidyverse functions that that work in similar ways, but with some added functionality.
